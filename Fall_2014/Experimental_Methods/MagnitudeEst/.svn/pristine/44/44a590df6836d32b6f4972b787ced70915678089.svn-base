function MullerLyerExp
% MullerLyerExp - Program to collect magnitude estimates for line length.
%
% Description:
% Program to collect magnitude estimates for line length.
% Parameters here are set for measuring the Muller-Lyer
% illusion.
%
% The observer's task is to enter the judged magnitude of
% each displayed line.
