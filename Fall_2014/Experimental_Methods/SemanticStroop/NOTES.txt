QUESTION: Does stroop interference relate to representation of color during comprehension of color-related words? 

PREDICTION: If stroop interference occurs on a conceptual level of color representation, then similar interference should occur during comprehension of color-related words. Further, this interference should be systematic, meaning that color-related words with the same color category should engender similar patterns of interferences

METHOD: Use the stroop paradigm to collect interference measures (RT), and then use MDS to observe whether color-related words within the same color category engender similar patterns of interference (when paired with different ink colors) -- if similar patterns of interference, then should cluster in MDS plot. Can also quantitatively analyze by comparing correlations within- and between- category (off of a dissimilarity matrix, for example)

Another way to state the goal: Trying to uncover color categories through similarity in patterns of stroop interference (the MDS analysis is blind to color category, it just has patterns of interference for the 24 words)

%% COLOR CATEGORIES %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Colors used: RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, PURPLE
- Would be easier using just four (RYGB), but would be less likely to find the effect we're looking for, 
i.e. similar patterns of interference for color-related words within the same color category (because requires a range of 
colors within which we can compare interference)


%% WORDS %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
RED: cherry, ruby, rose, blood
ORANGE: apricot, tiger, carrots, tangerine
YELLOW: banana, sun, lemon, canary
GREEN: broccoli, lime, grass, emerald
BLUE: denim, ocean, *sapphire, *sky
PURPLE: plum, eggplant, *raisins, *lilac

%% DESIGN %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
6 color-categories X 4 words X 6 hues = 144 trial-types
- optimally 3 trials per subject = 432 trials, 3 blocks

From Smithson et al (2006)
- Target words presented in uppercase Arial font
- Height of letters subtended a visual angle of 1.0 degrees from viewing distance of 1 meter
- Words presented with a 200-ms ramped (raised-cosine) onset and remained visible until participant responded

My thoughts
- We should probably leave word up until response to maximize interference. Or would it maximize interference? There's probably an optimal duration of word presentation: long enough so that the word is definitely processed, but short enough that the participant can't use a color-matching strategy (that is, ignore the word after processing)
- Height/visual angle of words is probably not importantâ€¦ also not sure of importance of "ramped" onset
